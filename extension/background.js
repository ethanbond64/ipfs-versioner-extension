// TODO
// IF NOT YET TRACKED
    // Provide entrypoint to diff and upload api
// IF TRACKED 
    // Compare to last version, if different upload the changes through the api (TODO)
    // Load versions into page if they exist
    // Diff view can be handled here, but would be best to do most of that with css
