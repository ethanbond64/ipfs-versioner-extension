# IDEA

Problem >
Websites change, articles change. No good way to hold them accountable to what they say, no good way to see previous versions (or diffs)


Solution >
Use IPFS with a chrome extension so users can mark sites to be held accountable and to me checked against previous versions



# Planning
## Phase 1
Extension records versions by url
Client page catalogoues recorded urls/pages
## Phase 2
Add filecoin when submitting a page to incentivize persisting versions on the network
## Phase 3
Gamification with filecoin rewards paid back to those who record newer versions ?
